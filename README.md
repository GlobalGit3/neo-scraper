## Installation

For development see [build/debug](#Builddebug).

### Firefox

Just download the .xpi from [release tab](https://github.com/neobooru/SzuruChrome/releases) and install it.

### Chrome

I can't create a valid .crx file, which means that you'll have to use [Chrome's "Load unpacked extension"](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked) feature.
You can download a .zip containing the needed files from the [release tab](https://github.com/neobooru/SzuruChrome/releases). Check [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38011386) if you want to get rid of the developer extension popup.

## Build/debug

```sh
# Install node modules
pnpm install

# Live dev build (watch)
pnpm dev

# Production build
pnpm build
```

After this you can load them in your browser.  
Chrome: `chrome://extensions/` → "Load unpacked" → Select `./dist` folder  
Firefox: `about:debugging` → "Load Temporary Add-on..." → Select any file in the `./dist` folder (it will load all files)

See [the developer docs](./docs/DEVELOPER.md) for more information.

## Planned features

These are some things I might work on. Though honestly I don't expect this extension to change much anytime soon.

- Finishing the initial version of this add-on (see visual design doc for all features)
- Right click any image on a page to import it
- Configurable list of tags to always ignore (e.g. tagme, highres)
- [low priority] Import artist commentary
